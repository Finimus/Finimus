## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Christian and believe that God helps me in everything I do. Christian values guide me to work with seriousness, respect, and integrity.

I’m passionate about **artificial intelligence** and **cybersecurity**, constantly exploring modern technologies to understand how they work and how to use them effectively and safely.

I enjoy testing AI applications — from image and sound generators to advanced language models — and finding ways to apply AI in **practical and creative** projects.

Additionally, I work on testing, installing, and configuring operating systems, especially Linux distributions like **Zorin OS, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint**, often running them directly from USB or SD cards. I have experience in **system optimization, configuration, troubleshooting**, and I am deeply interested in **cybersecurity** principles and practices.

I’m familiar with various online tools and browser extensions and have a personal library of interesting applications I use in my projects.
