## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Christian and believe that God helps me in everything I do. Christian values guide me to work with seriousness, respect, and integrity.

I’m passionate about **artificial intelligence**, constantly testing modern AI applications and platforms — from image and sound generators to advanced language models and creative tools.

I enjoy exploring how algorithms work and finding ways to apply AI in **practical and creative** projects.

Additionally, I work on testing, installing, and configuring operating systems, especially Linux distributions like **Zorin OS, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint**, often running them directly from USB or SD cards. I have experience in **system optimization, configuration, and troubleshooting**.

I’m familiar with various online tools and browser extensions and have a personal library of interesting applications I use in my projects.
